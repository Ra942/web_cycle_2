    <h3>The Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV engineered and manufactured by Cadillac.
         It was Cadillac's first major entry into the SUV market. The Escalade was introduced for
          the 1999 model year in response to competition from the Mercedes-Benz ML-Class and Lexus LX
           and to Ford's 1998 release of the Lincoln Navigator. The Escalade project went into production 
           only ten months after it was approved. The Escalade is built in Arlington, Texas. The word "escalade"
            refers to a siege warfare tactic of scaling defensive walls or ramparts with the aid of ladders or siege towers.</h3>
